  <p>This project is a challenge from Ide@al TI. It consists of creating a virtual store using the products registered in the Fake Store API. In the project we can see all products with name, description, image and unit value, filter by category and sort by price, grade or alphabetical order. It is also possible to add products to a cart and on the cart page view the total purchase amount and the products that will be purchased.</p>
